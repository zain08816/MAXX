  An automated web-scraper which analyzes digital expression (i.e. Twitter posts) for linguistic patterns which have been         statistically related to extreme states of mind, such as mental illness or risk of harming oneâ€™s self and/or others.
  
  Input:
    Twitter account
    
  Output:
    Risk assessment of given account
    
  Algorithm:
    Monitors for and identifies certain linguistic factors which may be cause for concern
    
  Activates an alert if:
    a certain amount of risk factors are identified, and/or
    many risk factors are used in combination with each other
    
  Future plans:
    Generalize for use with platforms other than Twitter (Facebook, Reddit, Instagram)
    Refine the analysis algorithm
    Base the algorithm purely on hard research
