  Monitored
  Analysis for 
  eXtreme 
  eXpressions
  
  An automated web-scraper which analyzes digital expression (i.e. Twitter posts) for linguistic patterns which have been         statistically related to extreme states of mind, such as mental illness or risk of harming one’s self and/or others.
  
  Input:
    Twitter account
  Output:
    Risk assessment of given account
    
  Algorithm:
    Monitors for and identifies certain linguistic factors which may be cause for concern
    
  Activates an alert if:
    a certain amount of risk factors are identified, and/or
    many risk factors are used in combination with each other
    
  Future plans:
    Generalize for use with platforms other than Twitter
    Refine the analysis algorithm
    Base the algorithm purely on hard research
